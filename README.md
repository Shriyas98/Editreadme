# EE577A Lab 1 Part 1
## Description
In Lab1 Part 1 of EE577A, we were assigned three tasks to be performed using Python scripting. The objective of this lab is to get us familiar with Python scripting which is used in industry for various simulation and automation steps of design and verification.

## Task 1
A Python script (lab1p1.py) that reads the sample input text file text_in.txt. The file includes special characters and numbers. The script then writes every word in text_in.txt into an output file text_out1.txt with the following requirement: for each paragraph in text_in.txt, you should rewrite the words in the paragraph in reverse order.
